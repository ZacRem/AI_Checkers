# AI Connect 4

This project showcases proficiency in artificial intelligence, focusing on the implementation of Connect Four with varying levels of AI players.

# Skills Demonstrated
1. **Random vs Random Player:**
* Fundamentals of game development.
* Utilizing randomization for player moves.
* Statistical analysis to determine win percentages.

2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning:**
* Advanced AI techniques for game-playing.
* Implementation of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm for optimized decision-making.
* Understanding and mitigating the computational complexity of game trees.

3. **A Star Algorithm**
* Crafting effective heuristics for game evaluation.
* Developing a heuristic that captures the essence of the Connect Four strategy.
* Fine-tuning to balance computational efficiency and strategic accuracy.

# Usage
1. **Random vs Random:**
* Run the section in the .ipynb to get the results of random vs random and it should be around 55%.
* Analyzed those results
2. **Aplha-Beta Player:**
* Execute the section of Alpha-Beta Player to see the results.
3. **A Star Algorithm:**
* Run The A Star section to see the results of the algorithm with the Heuristic.

# Results
Evaluate the outcomes of each game type, noting the effectiveness of different AI strategies in Connect Four.
